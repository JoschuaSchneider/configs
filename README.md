# configs :pencil2:
> A collection of my configs (editors, shells, prettier, eslint etc.)  
> Sprinkled with helpful resources for installation, setup or configuration!

This gives me the possibility to store configurations for all kinds of project types, comment and update them and reuse them in the future.

    - [Overview and resources](vscode/VSCODE.md)
    - [settings.json](vscode/settings.json)



### important notes

The configuration files in the root folder are just for formatting all the other .js and .json files.

If you are looking for general `prettier` configs for example, look into the prettier directory.

Why should you care about my configs?

**Turns out, they can become your configs too!**

Why not look into configurations you also use or you are trying to setup?
You think there is something wrong or missing with my configs, you have questions or need help setting them up for yourself?

Write **an issue** asking your **question** or open a **pull request**!
